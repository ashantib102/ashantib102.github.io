This is my current portfolio website, developed using a combination of resources such as YouTube tutorials, W3Schools, and additional guides. I incorporated advanced CSS features, including Flexbox for responsive layouts, animations for dynamic user interactions, and smooth transitions to enhance the user experience. To add a personalized touch, I embedded an audio file in the navbar to welcome users to the site, complete with customized controls for a seamless interface. This project reflects my ability to adapt and apply guidance from multiple sources while implementing original design ideas.
